    "The pipeline also needs to have one mask of brain areas. The first step of BASC is to use a region growing algorithm to reduce the spatial dimension of fMRI data to about 1000 small regions (called atoms). This stage is very memory hungry, because it runs on a concatenation of all time series from all subjects. To save memory, the region growing is run on each area independently. Typically, the pipeline uses the AAL parcellation for that purpose (or, more precisely, a tweaked version of the AAL adapted to the MNI ICBM non-linear template, see the [doc](http://niak.simexp-lab.org/pipe_region_growing.html#publication-guidelines)). The NIAK preprocessing pipeline generates this mask, which is automatically grabbed by `niak_grab_fmri_preprocess`. But here we are using low resolution data which do not come with a mask, so we are going to grab the AAL template from NIAK and resample it at the right resolution.  "

Note that, even though we selected only 10, 20 and 30 in our grid, that grid is strictly used only at the individual level. At the group and consensus levels, other parameters are explored, in the neighbourhood of the number of individual clusters. We can now set these parameters in the pipeline to generate stability maps and parcellations:"
