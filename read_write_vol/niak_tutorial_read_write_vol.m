%% Reading volumes

% To read the data, use niak_read_vol
[hdr,vol] = niak_read_vol('single_subject_cambridge_preprocessed_nii/fmri_sub00156_session1_rest.nii.gz');

% The hdr output is a structure with a full description of the volume
% hdr.info contains some basic info found in both nifti and minc
hdr.info

% For example, the voxel size is found in 
hdr.info.voxel_size

% All the detailed information are contained in hdr.details
% This field will vary based on the format of the original volume
% Here, for nifti, each field corresponds to a nifti field
hdr.details

% The vol output is the data itself, in either a 3D or a 4D array
% Any normalization (min/max) has been applied
% It is in voxel space however, and no spatial transformation has been applied
size(vol)

%% Write volume

% The name of the volume to write is going into the header
hdr.file_name = 'mean_vol.nii.gz';

% The number of time frames can vary, and is automatically updated
% Let's comupte the average volume
vol_mean = mean(vol,4);

% The writting operation looks like
niak_write_vol(hdr,vol_mean);
